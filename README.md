# espurnapm-unraid

With this UnRaid plugin you can turn a ESPurna device into an energy monitor for your server.

A user in the Unraid forum asked me if I could adapt the [Tasmota Power Monitor](https://github.com/Flippo24/tasmotpm-unraid) plugin for ESPurna as well. The structure of the plugin is very similar. But I still decided to create a separate plugin.

## Introduction

Before you start, be sure that you protect your ESPurna device against incorrect operation. So that you don't accidentally turn off your server. Use the plugin and device at your own risk. I will not be responsible for any damage.

I do not own an ESPurna device and can therefore only offer limited support.

Created in Unraid 6.9.1
